# Default Admin Credentials

After installation, only ONE admin user is created automatically.

## Admin User

**Email:** admin@infopercept.com  
**Password:** Welcome@ATS  
**Role:** admin

## Important Security Notes

⚠️ **CHANGE THE DEFAULT PASSWORD IMMEDIATELY AFTER FIRST LOGIN!**

1. Log in with the default credentials
2. Navigate to your profile settings
3. Change the password to a strong, unique password
4. Keep your credentials secure

## Creating Additional Users

After logging in as admin, you can create additional users through the application interface:

- **HR Users:** For managing recruitment processes
- **Team Members:** For conducting interviews and providing feedback
- **Requesters:** For requesting new positions
- **Candidates:** For job applicants

## No Sample Data

The system no longer creates sample users, jobs, or test data during installation. This ensures a clean production environment where you have full control over your data.

All users, jobs, and applications should be created through the application interface after the initial admin login.
